Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) are critical metrics in disaster recovery planning. The values you choose for these objectives depend on the specific requirements and business needs of the application or system. They represent the maximum allowable downtime and data loss after a disruption.

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
    * In case of single AZ outage, minimum RTO would be to get updated DNS changes. In case of Multi-AZ deployment, standby instance in another AZ is already running and data is replicated synchronously. This ensures quick recovery.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
    * In this case, following factors will be considered:
        i) Time to bring read replica as a standalone primary instance: This typically takes 15-20 minutes.
        ii) Time to apply new DNS changes in application to connect to new end point. Depending upon application design this can take anywhere from 15-120 minutes. If application is using centralized key/value management like Hashicorp Vault, change can be done only at one place.
    * To summarize, it can take minimum 45-60 minutes for RTO.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
    * In Multi-AZ scenario, automatic backups are enabled. It means AWS will take full snapshot once a day.
    * AWS also does transactional log backups every 5 minutes.
    * However there are other considerations also to be made.
        i) Accidental database deletion: In order to avoid it, we need to enable database deletion protection. Also, add explicit deny policy at IAM level.
        ii) Failure to take auto snapshots: Take manual snapshots.
    * Considering all of this, minimum RPO for a single AZ is 5 minutes.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
    * In Multi-AZ, Multi-region mode, database is updated asynchronously between Primary and read replica.
    * During initial setup and installation time, it takes minimum 15-20 minutes for system to get into Available state.
    * Considering this, minimum RPO for single region outage is around 15 minutes.
